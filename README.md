## THEORY

Op-amp in open-loop configuration has limited application due to its enormous open-loop gain. Controlled gain can be achieved by taking a part of the output signal to the input through feedback.  
This is called a **Closed-Loop Configuration**.

The four basic types of closed-loop amplifier configurations are:
- Inverting amplifier  
- Non-inverting amplifier  
- Differential amplifier
- Instrumentation amplifier 

The entire configuration can operate with either AC or DC input.

### **Inverting Amplifier**

This is the most widely used op-amp configuration.  
The output voltage Vo  is fed back to the inverting input terminal through the  Rf - R1 network.  
The negative sign in gain indicates a **phase shift of 180°**.


Acl = -RF/R1

### **Non-Inverting Amplifier**

If the signal is applied to the non-inverting input terminal without inversion, it is called a **non-inverting amplifier**.  
Here, the output is fed back to the inverting terminal, and **no phase shift** occurs.


ACL = 1 + RF/R1

## DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER

A circuit that amplifies the **difference** between two input signals is called a **Differential Amplifier**.  
It is useful in instrumentation applications.  
If the two input signals are identical, the output is ideally **zero**.


A = Vo/{V2 - V1} = -Rf/R1

## INSTRUMENTATION AMPLIFIER

THEORY:

An instrumentation amplifier is the intermediate stage of a instrumentation system. The signal source of the instrumentation amplifier is the output of the transducer. Many transducers output do not have the ability or sufficient strength to drive the next following stages. Therefore, instrumentation amplifiers are used to amplify the low-level output signal of the transducer so that it can drive the following stages such as indicator or displays.
The major requirements of a instrumentation amplifier are precise, low-level signal amplification where low-noise, low thermal and time drifts, high input resistance & accurate closed-loop gain, low power consumption, high CMRR & high slew rate for superior performance.
The output of Instumentation amplifier is given by
Vo = RF/R1[1+ 2R’/R][V2-V1]

PROCEDURE:

1.	Select the entire resistor with the same value. Let R be the gain varying resistor with different values of resistance for simplicity let R be a constant value.
2.	Connect the circuit as shown in the circuit diagram.
3.  + Vcc and - Vcc supply is given to the power supply terminal of the Op-Amp IC.
4.	Give the input V1 and V2 to the non-inverting terminals of first & second op-amp respectively.
5.	By varying the value of RG, measure the output voltage for common mode and differential mode operation. Since RG is selected as constant value, provide different input value of V1 and V2.
6.	Check the theoretical value with the experimental value.
7.	The output voltage is obtained in the Multimeter and the input and output voltage waveforms are plotted in a graph sheet
